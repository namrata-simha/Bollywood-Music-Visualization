# Bollywood-Music-Visualization
In this Project we will try to visualize the evolution of the genres of music in Bollywood and retrieve different songs from different artists, whether it is singer/lyricist/music composer of the songs in these movies. These songs are from the many types of music that have been around for the past 50 years in the Indian Film Industry.

The data we have used is from the website http://www.hindigeetmala.net/category/ which we have scraped using the ./makeDataset.py code
